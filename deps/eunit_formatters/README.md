# eunit_formatters

Because eunit's output sucks. Let's make it better.

Here's the progress formatter running with profiling and ANSI colors
turned on:

## Setup

Add `eunit_formatters` as a dep in your `rebar.config`, if using [rebar3](http://rebar3.org) place it under the `test` profile:

```erlang
{profiles, [{test,
            [{deps, [
                    {eunit_formatters, ".*",
                     {git, "git://github.com/seancribbs/eunit_formatters", {branch, "master"}}}
                    ]}]}]}.
```

Otherwise, when using rebar, simply add it to the normal deps list.

Now configure eunit to use one of the output formatters (currently
only `eunit_progress`):

```erlang
{eunit_opts, [
     no_tty,  %% This turns off the default output, MUST HAVE
     {report, {eunit_progress, [colored, profile]}} %% Use `profile' to see test timing information
     %% Uses the progress formatter with ANSI-colored output
     ]}.
```
